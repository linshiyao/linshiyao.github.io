	<p>I'm a digital artist. I mainly focus in video producing and I'm in progress of becoming a social documentary filmmaker. I seek the extraodinary out of ordinary things.</p>

	<p>I was born in a generation where physical satisfications are easy to gain, but the real pain becomes abstract. People suffer spiritually more than ever. As technologies swelling, what also swelling is the loneliness human have to eventually deal with. One interesting phenomenon I've found is that more people encountered mental disability such as bipolar in my generation. Me being one of the "patiences", often feel that living in my imaginition could be more interesting than living in the reality. It made me think: did the world depress us or did we depress the world? In this busy world, I prefer not to talk, but let my art talk for me. I intend to create art that are visually compelling and express my hidden thoughts. I desire to be understood by strangers. </p>

	 <p>Like many artists do, I'm also inspired by natural disasters, social conflict and political problem. Unlike most artists, I never expect to change the world through my art. To be honest, I don't believe the world will ever change. Despite the amount of effort people put in search of an everlasting harmony in the universe, the population will still grow, the war will still exists and the earth will still get drained by human behavior. Nothing will stop the end of the world from happening. I believe that's how the universe balance itself, and I fully respect that. The only thing I do is to record the stories, restore the truths and exist in my own fashion. </p>

	 <p>My goal is simple and selfish. I'm not trying to change the world. Instead, I'm trying to not let the world change the things in me.</p>
