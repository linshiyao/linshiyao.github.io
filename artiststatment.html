	<p>I'm a digital artist. I mainly focus in video producing and I'm in progress of becoming a social documentary filmmaker. I seek the extraodinary out of ordinary things.</p>

	<p>I was born in a generation where physical satisfications are easy to gain, but the real pain becomes abstract. People suffer spiritually more than ever. As technology swelling, people's personal space are reversed by social medias, unwanted communications, unwanted relationships. What is also swelling is the loneliness. One interesting phenomenon I've found is that more people encounter mental disability in my generation such as depression or bipolar. More people, have something they want to get out from theirI have the same pain, which almost swallow me. Therefore, I use video art as an antidote to my depression. I intend to create art that are visually compelling and express my emotion. I desire to be understood by strangers. I'd prefer not to talk, but use art to communicate. </p>

	 <p>Like many artists do, I am often inspired by natural disaster, social conflict and political problem. But unlike most of them, I never expect using my art to change the world. I don't believe the world will change at all. Despite the amount of effort people put into for searching a balance, nothing will stop the end of the world from happening. Population will keep growing, war will always exists and the earth is still getting drained by human behavior. The technologies will improve, and human will get lonely. I guess that's the way how the universe balance itself. The only thing I attempt to do through my art is to record the story that are happening, restore the truth and being exist. </p>

	 <p>My goal is simple and selfish. I'm not trying to change the world through my art. Instead, I'm trying to not let the world change the things in me.</p>
