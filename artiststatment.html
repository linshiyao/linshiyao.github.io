	<p>I'm a digital artist. I mainly focus in video producing and I'm in progress of becoming a social documentary filmmaker. I seek the extraordinary out of ordinary things.</p>

	<p>I was born in a generation where physical satisfactions are easy to gain, but the real pain becomes abstract. People suffer spiritually more than ever. One interesting phenomenon I've found in my generation is that more people encountered mental disability such as bipolar. Me being one of the "patients", often feel like living in my imagination would be more interesting than living in the reality. It makes me think: did the world depress us or did we depress the world? Probably both. In this busy world, language becomes pallid. I prefer not to talk, but let my art talk for me. I intend to create art that are visually compelling and express my hidden thoughts. My primary goal for art is selfish: I desire to be understood by strangers. </p>

	 <p>Like many artists do, I'm also inspired by natural disasters, social conflict and political problem. However, unlike most of them, I don't expect to change the world through my art. In fact, I don't believe the world will ever change. Despite the amount of effort people put into for searching an everlasting harmony in the universe: population is still growing, war is still existing, and the earth is still getting drained by human behavior. Nothing will stop the end of the world from happening. I believe that's how the universe balance itself, and I fully respect that. The only thing that interest me a lot and often is ethical dilemma and humanity. I want to show the beautiful side of humanity, as well as the dark side of it. It's the contradiction in humanity that torture me, but meanwhile it amaze and attract me.</p>

	 <p>My final goal for art is simple: Instead of trying to change the world, I'm trying to not let the world change the things in me. </p>
