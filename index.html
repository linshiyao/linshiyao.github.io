	  I am a digital artist in training.<br> I love cats, flower, writing, and daydreaming. <br><br>
	  Living in a world surrounded by many contemporary artists, I considered myself as a more classic person due to my obsession in art history. I'm particularly influenced by Baroque art, and I intend to create art that express my hidden emotion which will evoke same emotional response from my audience. I mainly work with video and want to become a social documentary filmmaker. <br><br>
	  In real life, I could communicate very well to various people and play different roles as needed. However, that's not the authentic me; I often get exhausted and want to quit from the reality. I found art (especially video art) became my protective shell, I could be as much demonstrative as I want to be inside this shell. One thing makes me addicted to videography is that I could tell my story without neccessarily be the protagonist in my video. <br><br>
	  I'm gradually stepping into the digital era, knowing it will eventually become my comfort zone.
